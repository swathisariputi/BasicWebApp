	<p>A computer lab is a space which provides computer services to a defined community.Our Computer laboratory-1(VNIT) have 50 machines which are HP,Lenovo make Dual Core Desktop computers.We generally use this lab for practice and for having computer based examinations.The use of information and communications technologies in education has increased dramatically over the past decade. At the university level, computers are now used in most disciplines, either as an adjunct to the traditional lecture or to deliver the material on-line. Consequently, students are now required to master computer skills before they can master the subject being taught. To accommodate this need, tertiary institutions have provided access to computer laboratories.<br> A computer laboratory is an expensive resource in terms of equipment and people, and should be used as effectively as possible. Computer laboratory classes may be organized as closed laboratories which are scheduled and staffed in the same way as other classes, or as open laboratories where students come and go as they please. </p>

    <h2>Basic Electrical Laboratory</h2>
    <a href="https://vnit.ac.in/eee/index.php/laboratories/">Electrical Engineering Department,VNIT</a>
	<p>Electrical Engineering play an important role in all the branches of Engineering and Science. It deals with electrical transducers, electronic instrumentation, signal conditioning. Microprocessors, microcontrollers, PC based instrumentation system, power electronics & control systems, telemetry, data transmission etc.<br>We are introduced with various measuring instrumewhe.We learnt about transformers which we can see every where.The experiments are designed to expose Students to practical executions.We can learn about basic principles/laws which govern production of electricuty </p>

    <h2>Robotics & FMS</h2>
    <a href="https://vnit.ac.in/mech/index.php/laboratories/">Mechanical Engineering Department,VNIT</a>
  <p>Mechanical Engineering is the core discipline since the dawn of engineering culture, which offers a satisfying & rewarding career. It plays a key role in developing, operating and manufacturing new machines, devices and processes to benefit humanity. No wonder Mechanical Engineers are most sought after technocrats across wide spectrum of industries. They apply their creative imaginations and professional skills to combine both theory and practice in variety of situations. The department of mechanical engineering is proud of its state of the art infrastructure and qualified faculty and support staff, which is highly essential for producing the best.<br>Its aim is to provide the students a perfect blend of intellectual and practical experiences that help them to serve the society and address a variety of needs. Students have good opportunity to understand the technology through machinery equipped labs with Lathe machines, Universal Testing Machine, Fluid machinery apparatus etc. so as to enable them to be socially conscious and technologically skilled and contribute towards solving socially relevant technical problems. The laboratories provide the students with a practical application of the studied curriculum.  </p>
